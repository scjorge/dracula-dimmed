# Dracula Dimmed

This theme is based on [Dracula Official](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dracula-theme.theme-dracula) and [GitHub Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)

This is a mix I made to Dracula Soft and Github Dimmed.

I hope you enjoyed 😉
